# Module-3-Password-Generator

## Description

- The challenge was to create a randomized password generator with the code starter through javascript.

## Installation

1. Researched different examples of password generators and broke down the criteria into smaller action items
2. Used arrays to assign the different password criteria 
3. Created prompts with open text and confirm pop up boxes to confirm criteria
4. Created a for loop to concatenate all the criteria together in one string 


## Usage

This application can be used to generate a random password of 8-128 characters.
